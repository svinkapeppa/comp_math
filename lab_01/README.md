# Laboratory #1

## Task

Implement one algorithm for the numerical solution of systems of linear equations.  
I choose [Conjugate gradient method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method).

## Prerequisites

All scripts are written in Python 3.  
Libraries:
* `math` - comes with default Python 3
* `numpy` - external library, needed for random numbers generation
(see [generator.py](generator.py))
