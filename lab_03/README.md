# Laboratory #3

## Task

The task was to choose algorithms and implement them. Maximum reward is 1. Rewards are given in brackets.

Algorithms:
* MC (0.5)
* MCMC (0.5)
* Explore different random generators for MC (0.5)
* Cubic spline (1)
* FFT (0.5)

I choose MC and FFT.

### MC

Implement MC Integration for multiple integral. Change properties of `Func` class in order to change the integral. 

### FFT

Implemented FFT and CZT in order to get it working with arbitrary number of points.

## Prerequisites

All scripts are written in Python 3. All used libraries come as a standard Python library package.
